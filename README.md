# 📊 Sales Orders Analysis using Python & MySQL

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes a sales orders dataset (sourced from Kaggle) using **Python** and **MySQL**.  
The goal was to uncover business insights such as top-performing products, regional sales distribution, and year-over-year growth.  

I combined **SQL for analysis** with **Python for database connection & execution** to build an end-to-end data workflow.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** → SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook  
- **MySQL** → Database, schema design, SQL queries  
- **SQL** → Window functions, CTEs, aggregations

## 📊 Business Analysis Performed
1. **Top 10 Revenue Products** → Highest sales-generating products  
2. **Regional Insights** → Top 5 products in each region  
3. **Month-over-Month Growth** → Sales comparison between 2022 vs 2023  
4. **Category Trends** → Month with highest sales per category  
5. **Profit Growth** → Sub-category with highest year-over-year profit growth
